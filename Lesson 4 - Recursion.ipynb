    "## When To Use Recursion\n",
    "First, there is a caveat regarding recursion. Depending on the system, and how recursion is supported, sometimes it is not very efficient to solve a problem recursively. Having said that, the functions that lend themselves best to recursion are those functions where the output of <b>x</b> is based on the function of <b>x - 1</b>.  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "For example, factorial is a function that lends itself to recursion because 4! is the same as 4&ast;3!. Some of the sort algorithms from <b>[Lesson 2](Lesson%202%20-%20Sorting.ipynb)</b> also have elegant solutions when using recursion.  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "An important thing to remember about recursive functions is that they <b>MUST</b> have a stopping condition. Without this stopping condition, the algorithm could run until it consumes all available resources. The stopping condition can be a simple <b>if</b> statement that returns without executing another recursive call. For example:  \n",

Notice, thought, that no variable is required to store the result and we don't have to keep track of the value of n. All we have to do is note that when n is 1 we should just return n. One other thing to note is that both the looping and the recursive implementations only work for positive values.
