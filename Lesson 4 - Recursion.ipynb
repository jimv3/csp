    "First, there is a caveat regarding recursion. Depending on the system, and how recursion is supported, sometimes it is not very efficient to solve a problem recursively. Having said that, the functions that lend themselves best to recursion are those functions where the output of <b>x</b> is based on the function of <b>x - 1</b>.  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "For example, factorial is a function that lends itself to recursion because 4! is the same as 4&ast;3!. Some of the sort algorithms from <b>[Lesson 2](Lesson%202%20-%20Sorting.ipynb)</b> also have elegant solutions when using recursion.  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "An important thing to remember about recursive functions is that they <b>MUST</b> have a stopping condition. Without this stopping condition, the algorithm could run until it consumes all available resources. The stopping condition can be a simple <b>if</b> statement that returns without executing another recursive call. For example:  \n",
    "`\n",
    "if n < 1:\n",
    "  return 1\n",
    "`  \n",
    "could be the stopping condition for a recursive algorithm.  \n",
