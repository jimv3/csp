    "Big O is a way to discuss the growth of functions by describing the time efficiency of those functions. In other words, as the algorithm has to process more information, what happens to the time it takes to process that information. As we discuss time in Big O we really mean \"relative\" time. An algorithm's Big O does not change from computing device to computing device. The algorithm will run faster on modern hardware than it does on older hardware but compared to other algorithms that solve the same problem it's time efficiency stays relatively the same as compared to those other algorithms.

    "The correct answer to the question above is (c). The reason for this is that the time of the function increases relative to the size of the input. O(n) is how we represent an algorithm whose time efficiency is directly correlated to the size of the data being processed. O(1) represents a constant time algorithm. In other words, if the size of the input increases or decreases there is no change in how long the algorithm takes to complete. We will see an example of that shortly. When we see O(n<sup>2</sup>) that means the function's execution time is relative to the square of the size of input. An input of size 8 will take approximately 16 times longer to execute than an input of size 2 and so on."
