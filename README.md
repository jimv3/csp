# Computer Science Primer
## Welcome
This project has been created as an assignment in an introductory education technology class. Feel free to view the lessons or check out the Wiki to see where the project is headed.

## Motivation
The motiviation for this project extends beyond the requirement for a class. Over my career I have worked with self-taught developers and mentored with a coding bootcamp near my home. I consistently encounter people who wonder if they are missing something by not having a traditional computer science background.

The goal of this project is to offer learning opportunities for those who feel they would like to understand computer science a little more deeply. The primary aim is for students who have graduated from, or are currently enrolled in, a coding bootcamp to have resources available that can teach them computer science subjects in an approachable forum.

This is in no means a limitation on who might find the lessons useful. Anyone with a desire to go deeper could benefit from working through these subjects. Self-taught developers and current computer science students may find the material useful as either something new to learn or as a supplement to current learning material.

## Running the Notebooks
It is highly recommended to use [Anaconda](https://anaconda.com/download) to run the notebooks. Anaconda is cross-platform and will help with the management of Python virtual environments.
- Optionally install Anaconda
- Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/jimv3/csp.git`
- Open a terminal window/command window in the cloned repository folder
- Launch jupyter notebook `jupyter notebook`
- In the browser window that launches, select the lesson you would like to work through

_The lessons are in order for pedagogical reasons; however, you may complete them in any order you choose_
