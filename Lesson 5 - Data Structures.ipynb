    "# Lesson 5 - Data Structures\n",
    "This lesson will cover some of the more common and basic data structures in computer science. You will learn about linked lists (forward-only and doubly-linked), stacks, queues, and trees (AVL and B-tree). One common thread that runs through these structures is that they use a **node** to store the information. These nodes are structures in and of themselves. They contain the object being held and a pointer or pointers to other nodes. In the case of a root node (the first node in the structure) or a terminating node (the last node in the structure), the pointer may be null.\n",
    "## Linked Lists\n",
    "Linked lists come in two basic forms. There are forward-only linked lists. These linked lists have nodes that contain the data and a pointer to the next node in the list. The program will maintain a pointer to the root node and can then iterate through the nodes by simply following the pointers. Once a node with *next* pointer of null (None in Python) is reached, the list has been fully iterated."

    "Now that we have defined what the nodes look like it is time to discuss linked lists and doubly-linked lists. There is a base amount of functionality that is required for the lists to be usable. At a minimum you must be able to add nodes and iterate through the list. There are other methods that can be supported to improve functionality such as deleting nodes, searching for a given index, finding a list element with a certain value, and others depending on usage. For this lesson we are focusing on the required methods for a minimally useful linked list. Please feel free to write your own doubly-linked list (example available in **lesson5/doubly_linked_list_example.py**)."
