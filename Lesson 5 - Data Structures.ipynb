    "# Lesson 5 - Data Structures\n",
    "This lesson will cover some of the more common and basic data structures in computer science. You will learn about linked lists (forward-only and doubly-linked), stacks, queues, and trees (AVL and B-tree). One common thread that runs through these structures is that they use a **node** to store the information. These nodes are structures in and of themselves. They contain the object being held and a pointer or pointers to other nodes. In the case of a root node (the first node in the structure) or a terminating node (the last node in the structure), the pointer may be null.\n",
    "## Linked Lists\n",
    "A linked list is a collection of items, or data, that can expand at run time. Each element in the list is called a node. A node is an object that contains data and a pointer to other nodes in the list. Linked lists come in two basic forms. There are forward-only linked lists. These linked lists have nodes that contain the data and a pointer to the next node in the list. The program will maintain a pointer to the root node and can then iterate through the nodes by simply following the pointers. Once a node with *next* pointer of null (None in Python) is reached, the list has been fully iterated."

    "## Stacks and Queues\n",
    "Stacks and queues are special implementations of a linked list. Each adds a few functions that are not necessarily part of the linked list implementation. Stacks are called last-in-first-out data structures. This means that the last element added to the stack is the one that is available to be retrieved. Stacks work much like the real world. If you stack plates then the one that is available next is the one just added to the top. Queues, on the other hand, are similar to lines in the real world. Queues are call first-in-first-out structures. In other words, when you add something to a queue it is not the element retrieved until all the previously added items have been removed.\n",

Trees can also keep track of more than left and right branches. You can also include a middle or even more branches."
