    "# Lesson 5 - Data Structures\n",
    "This lesson will cover some of the more common and basic data structures in computer science. You will learn about linked lists (forward-only and doubly-linked), stacks, queues, and trees (AVL and B-tree). One common thread that runs through these structures is that they use a **node** to store the information. These nodes are structures in and of themselves. They contain the object being held and a pointer or pointers to other nodes. In the case of a root node (the first node in the structure) or a terminating node (the last node in the structure), the pointer may be null.\n",
    "## Linked Lists\n",
    "Linked lists come in two basic forms. There are forward-only linked lists. These linked lists have nodes that contain the data and a pointer to the next node in the list. The program will maintain a pointer to the root node and can then iterate through the nodes by simply following the pointers. Once a node with *next* pointer of null (None in Python) is reached, the list has been fully iterated."
