Also, it may be helpful to review __[Lesson 2](Lesson%202%20-%20Sorting.ipynb)__ if you are unfamiliar with sorting. We will be discussing search algorithms both from an implementation standpoint and from an efficiency standpoint. In this lesson we will cover binary search, indexed search, sequential search, and do an introduction to tree search."

    "Indexed searching is quite different from the binary search. For one thing, indexed searching does not require a sorted list. Since it works by going directly to the index of the element you are seeking the algorithm is simply to retrieve the element at the given index. To be more robust it would be prudent to ensure the index is within the range of the list. Another difference is that some sort of mechanism for storing the indexes must be introduced. The can be accomplished using a secondary list, or more commonly, by using a function that can calculate the index given the element's value (a hashing function for example)."
